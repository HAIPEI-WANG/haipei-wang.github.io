        <p>My first learning block at Imperial College ended last week. It also brought to an end of the Marketing Analytics module, which is probably the best analytical module that I have ever attended.</p>
<p>So here I would like to do a reorganized recap of the module for myself and I hope it may also help whoever else ‘accidentally’ ends up reading this blog.</p>
<p>Here goes the first episode of ‘Marketing with R – Recap,’ an introduction of Rstudio and segmentation with R.</p>
<p><em>Acknowledgement: I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Stijn Maesen and Imperial College Business School who generously shared his knowledge with me and provided a terrific learning environment.</em><br><img src="/images/ICBS-1.jpg" alt="Imperial College London"></p>
<h2 id="Data-amp-Marketing"><a href="#Data-amp-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Data &amp; Marketing"></a>Data &amp; Marketing</h2><p>We have been hearing people yelling ‘Data is everything’ for a long time. But how is data used in your marketing department and where should a beginner start from?</p>
<p>Mike Grigsby gave a perfect example in his book ‘<em>Marketing Analytics: A Practical Guide to Improving Consumer Insights Using Data Techniques</em>.’ I would like to provide a scenario inspired by his book. Please imagine you are the head of the marketing department in a video game company which has already launched several games in the market. It now possesses the historical sales data (probably on multiple platforms separately), price, advertisement cost, channel cost, promotion data, user account data, and other marketing-related data. These data were generated automatically when products were sold.</p>
<p><strong>ROMI</strong> |<br>As the head of the marketing department, you might be interested in the <strong>Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI)</strong>. Here is the thing that can be done to calculate your <strong>ROMI</strong>: build a regression model using sales data as the response variable and price, marketing cost, and even time as explanatory variables. By doing so, the marketing team will know how does their effort in pricing, advertising, and managing promotion affect actual sales performance. You can also build a reliable estimation model to predict how will the market respond to your marketing decisions in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Segmentation</strong> |<br>Since the company launched multiple games, you may want different game approaches different target players appropriately. You can easily segment your users by clustering analysis using the personal data you collected when they created their accounts. By doing so, you will know what kind of players want what kind of games. For example, you may find that First-person Shooter gamers have a totally different price sensitivity from the Simulation Video Games players. You will also find different social status, ages, and income status among different groups of players. You then can build your strategy to approach these targets differently and appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Client Management &amp; Social Media Management</strong> |<br>It’s all about keeping your players happy. You always want a low churn rate and keep your valuable clients. A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis will allow you to identify the players who are valuable (who will spend a lot of money on gaming) but are going to quit your games. A sentiment analysis keeps you updated with how people are feeling about your games on social media without actually reading through all the posts.</p>
<h2 id="Get-Started-with-R"><a href="#Get-Started-with-R" class="headerlink" title="Get Started with R"></a>Get Started with R</h2><p>Of course, I am sure that other languages work perfectly as well, but here I would like to introduce R. <strong>R</strong> is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It was created by two genius, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>Rstudio is opensource visualization software that I will use in later posts. You can download it freely through this link: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a></p>
<p>Before playing with R, you need to first set a working directory where you are going to store your R scripts and datasets.</p>
<pre><code># Set your working directory
  setwd(&quot;E:/Imperial College/Marketing Analytics/R working directory&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can click the ‘choose directory’ button under the ‘session’ dropdown menu:<br><img src="/images/setworkinginR.png" alt="Set working directory in Rstudio"></p>
<p>Then we will also need some packages that allow us to manipulate data:</p>
<pre><code># Install packages
  install.packages(&quot;package name&quot;)

# Load packages
  library(package name)</code></pre>
<p>Here we need these packages:</p>
<pre><code># Install packages
  install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
  install.packages(&quot;readxl&quot;)
  install.packages(&quot;corrplot&quot;)
  install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)
  install.packages(&quot;reshape2&quot;)

# Load packages
  library(tidyverse)
  library(readxl)
  library(corrplot)
  library(ggplot2)
  require(reshape2)</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that you need to load packages again every time to open Rstudio.</p>
<p>Alright then, we are clear to go now! I will start to manipulate a sales dataset from Airbnb in the next post (It is also open for download: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://tomslee.net/airbnb-data-collection-get-the-data">http://tomslee.net/airbnb-data-collection-get-the-data</a>).</p>
