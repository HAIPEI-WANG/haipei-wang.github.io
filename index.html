        <p><img src="/images/NoMansSkyOrigins.png" alt="A No Man&#39;s Sky Origins Post"><br>Hi, welcome to my post. Today I would like to introduce the TAM-SAM-SOM approach in New Market Entry strategy. And hopefully, we could apply this technique to a real-life business case, No Man’s Sky’s market entry in China.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-TAM-SAM-and-SOM"><a href="#What-are-TAM-SAM-and-SOM" class="headerlink" title="What are TAM, SAM and SOM?"></a>What are TAM, SAM and SOM?</h2><p><em>Firstly, I would like to give all the credit to Professor James Eteen at Imperial College Business School. I basically just learnt all these stuff yesterday in his online courses.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>TAM: Total Available Market</li>
<li>SAM: Serviceable Available Market</li>
<li>SOM: Serviceable Obtainable Market</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how James Eteen interpreted these terminologies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘<strong>TAM</strong> represents the total market size–people capable of acquiring my product/service.</p>
<p><strong>SAM</strong> represents 100% market share at a point in time<br> <em>Which is the number of potential customers that could be interested in buying my product or service (my choice of target customer segments).</em></p>
<p><strong>SOM</strong> is the ‘share of market’ at a point in time.<br><em>Which is Estimated target market share that could be achieved, considering economic trends, existing players’ shares, expected demand/forecast, countries, distribution channels.</em>‘</p>
<p>(James Eteen, 2020)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here comes an example to better understand these definitions:<br>Imagine that I am a bottled water producer and I want to enter a new market. Here is how I want to assess my potential market.</p>
<p>The <strong>Total Available Market</strong> here is the number of people who can drink bottled water, which is the total population of this market (please keep in mind that in some cases not all people can consume your product/service). The <strong>Serviceable Available Market</strong> will exclude those who drink tap water instead of bottled water. The <strong>Serviceable Obtainable Market</strong> is your estimation of your market share (you can estimate this using your competitors’ performance and your own performance in other markets).</p>
<p><img src="/images/TAM-SAM-SOM.png" alt="James Eteen, 2020"></p>
<p>Voila, that’s the basic idea and now we can estimate our revenue in the market.</p>
<h2 id="The-real-life-application–No-Man’s-Sky"><a href="#The-real-life-application–No-Man’s-Sky" class="headerlink" title="The real-life application–No Man’s Sky"></a>The real-life application–No Man’s Sky</h2><p><em>Why did I pick No Man’s Sky?</em><br><em>Because I want a job at Hello Games.</em> XD</p>
<p>I would like to put myself in this simulation situation: I want to launch No Man’s Sky in China and invest in localisation, marketing and all the supporting investment in this market. But how can I assess the potential return on investment?</p>
<h3 id="TAM"><a href="#TAM" class="headerlink" title="TAM |"></a>TAM |</h3><p><strong>Firstly</strong>, as we have already known that No Man’s Sky was launched in both PC and gaming consoles (Xbox and PlayStation), the TAM should be total PC owners plus total consoles owner in China. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nikopartners.com/chinas-console-tv-based-games-market/">Nikopartner</a> reported that there were 11 million console users in China in 2019. However, it becomes very tricky when calculating total PC users. Neither World bank nor OECD has this data. So here I am just going to use Statista’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278758/number-of-computers-per-100-households-in-china/#:~:text=Number%20of%20computers%20per%20100%20households%20in%20China%202000-2018&text=This%20statistic%20depicts%20the%20number,households%20in%20the%20previous%20year.">Number of computers per 100 households in China</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1037593/china-urban-household-number-by-affluency/">Urban household number in China</a> to estimate. So, there were roughly 72.09 million PC users in Chinese urban areas in 2019. (So here we narrow down our target market to Chinese urban market)<br><strong>Now we have the TAM = 83.09 million users in 2019</strong></p>
<h3 id="SAM"><a href="#SAM" class="headerlink" title="SAM |"></a>SAM |</h3><p><img src="/images/gamerevenuechina.png" alt="Lai Lin Thomala, Gaming Industry Revenue, 2020"><br>With the help of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www-statista-com.iclibezp1.cc.ic.ac.uk/statistics/445407/console-and-pc-game-revenue-in-china/">Statista</a>, this part is relatively easy.</p>
<p><strong>So now, SAM = 1,192 million yuan from 2015 to 2019</strong></p>
<h3 id="SOM"><a href="#SOM" class="headerlink" title="SOM |"></a>SOM |</h3><p>To calculate this, I would like to pick a benchmark. I chose Rainbow Six Seige (R6) here.</p>
<p>By 2019, R6 had generated $1.1 billion worldwide. (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2020/02/06/rainbow-six-siege-hits-over-55-million-registered-players/#5aeaaf5e172d">Matt Perez</a>, 2020) Meanwhile, approximately 19% of active users were from China mainland. (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://playercounter.com/call-of-duty-warzone/">Steam Spy</a>, 2017) Let’s assume that the revenue was contributed equally and proportionally around the world (I know this may lead to mistakes).</p>
<p><strong>Then in China from 2015 to 2019, the SOM of R6 = $1.1 billion x 19% / ￥1,192 million = 11.95%</strong></p>
<p>Let’s come back to No Man’s Sky then. So far, there have been 90,285 users in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=%E6%97%A0%E4%BA%BA%E6%B7%B1%E7%A9%BA&ie=utf-8&tab=good">Chinese No Man’s Sky online community</a>, comparing to 576,465 users in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tieba.baidu.com/f?ie=utf-8&kw=%E5%BD%A9%E8%99%B9%E5%85%AD%E5%8F%B7&fr=search">Chinese R6 community</a>. So, I will roughly estimate that in China, No Man’s Sky’s market share is 15.66% * R6’s market share.</p>
<p><strong>Here we go, in the same time scale, No Man’s Sky’s SOM = 15.66% x 11.95% = 1.87%</strong></p>
<p>This figure makes sense for me, given the fact that R6 is a lot more popular in China.</p>
<h3 id="Limitation"><a href="#Limitation" class="headerlink" title="Limitation:"></a>Limitation:</h3><p>Please note that I simplified the whole analysis, which makes the final prediction unreliable. Here I only want to give a quick insight into how could TAM-SAM-SOM framework be applied. And also, the interpretation of these figures are not provided in this article. (I wish I could have had more time and effort to do a full analysis.)</p>
<h2 id="The-End"><a href="#The-End" class="headerlink" title="The End"></a>The End</h2><p>Thanks for your reading!</p>

        <p>Hi! My name is Haipei WANG. This is the very first post on my brand new blog site. As you can understand in the first glance, I am a beginner in front end design. (You can say this website is pretty ugly) Though I would like to add fancy functions on my website, I am simply too “green hand” to handle all those javascript or whatever… However, let’s get back to this question “<strong>Why did I start this at all</strong>?”</p>
<p>I would like you to first have a look at how people are interested in “creating personal websites” in the past decade:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/2213_RC01/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"personal blog","geo":"","time":"2004-01-01 2020-09-27"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=all&q=personal%20blog","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

<p>It shows a declining trend in people’s interest in personal blogs starting from 2009. Probably because of the rise of those “personal branding tools,” including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/haipeiwang/?hl=en">Instagram</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/haipei-wang-48010b173/">Linkedin</a>. They are professional, beautify, standardized, and easy-to-use tools to expose yourself. So, why on earth did this amateur created this website?</p>
<p>Here comes the amazing part of “<strong>Personal Digital Transformation</strong>.”</p>
<h2 id="Could-I-stay-irrelevant"><a href="#Could-I-stay-irrelevant" class="headerlink" title="Could I stay irrelevant?"></a>Could I stay irrelevant?</h2><p>You see, I finished my bachelor degree in Emlyon business school and East China Normal University in business and administration. And even my current learning at Imperial College doesn’t show any relevance with coding or front end design. But from the courses I learnt and my working experience, I can be more than confident to say “It is totally necessary to at least try to code, to build a functional website myself, as a future marketing professional .” (Yes, I would like to describe myself in this way.)</p>
<p><img src="/images/CreativeTechnologists.png?80" alt="A picture of CreativeTechnologists"><br>In my last year in Emlyon, I majored in Creative Technologists, where I was taught about AI, IoT, and web designing. Given the fact that few of my colleagues had ever known about coding, when building our projects we had to frequently ask for help, by which means let our lovely instructors code for us. Imagine in a real business scenario, this is called outsourcing. I mean outsourcing is totally fine and in some case, outsourcing could be the best solution. But if you, as an entrepreneur or a manager, have no relevant background at all, you may be in serious trouble when dealing with outsourcing.</p>
<p>This leads to my working experience.</p>
<p><img src="/images/meatwork.png?40" alt="Me at Work"></p>
<p>I joined a startup at the end of 2018. It was a pure digital firm, but ironically none of the people even at least know how to create an HTML file. Of course, we outsourced everything. The lack of basic knowledge resulted in Information asymmetry and loss of control at last. We lost all initiatives in negotiation. We went over budget for the project. The worst thing was that we had to postpone our service online date. And of course, in the end, the entire project was a total failure.</p>
<p>Nobody can really stay away from digital transformation. Everyone knows that, but few react enough.</p>
<h2 id="What-can-I-do"><a href="#What-can-I-do" class="headerlink" title="What can I do?"></a>What can I do?</h2><p>Frankly speaking, until the question becomes “what could I have done?” the answer is always “I don’t know.” Instead of thinking about what to do is correct, I would like to try everything in every way.</p>
<p>Later in my professional career, I probably need to “sell” something or some ideas really hard online (marketing/digital marketing). So in this very beginning (let’s hope it is not too late), I will try to sell myself as hard as possible online. I will call it Digital Self-marketing (I am bad at giving names). I don’t need to be an expert in the digital world, but I definitely need to learn the basic so that I can get everything under control when I manage something later in a professional way. I hope this will avoid the awkward situation that I mentioned before.</p>
<p>So here comes my first blog. I will keep updating some interesting thoughts here. I promise they won’t be too long to read (I am lazy in fact). And I will keep updating the front design. I will try to make it beautiful and interactive.</p>
<p>I would like to end this with my favourite Latin saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si_vis_pacem,_para_bellum">Si vis pacem, para bellum</a><br><em>If you want peace, prepare for war</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you very much for reading.</p>
